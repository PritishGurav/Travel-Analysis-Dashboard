# Travel-Analysis-Dashboard
 
The Project Narrative: 
During the Indian Transport and Mobility Analysis, I found some interesting patterns and trends in the dataset that triggered the thought of a fresh project. The insight gained was that exploring the interesting avenues in the data would lead me there and help me build the Travel Analysis Dashboard.

The project aims at analyzing travel through segmented travel patterns, regional mobility, and transport preferences to gain actionable insights. With the same dataset, I wanted to come up with a fresh outlook about the data through creating an interactive yet aesthetically appealing dashboard.

Objective
This would help in analyzing travel behavior, regional trends, and mode preferences by making the use of advanced data visualization techniques such that users would have an easy intuitive and insightful dashboard.

Features
Imagination-reimagined Insight: A fresh perspective on the same dataset, bringing out travel-specific metrics.

Visual Storytelling: graph, map, and visual; engaging interpretation for the audience concerned.

User-friendly design: A dashboard made all set for both the technician and the non-technician to analyze and understand travel data.

Key Learning 
Using one data set to derive many different analysis variants. 
Experimenting with some of the advanced visualization tools in Power BI.
Narratives that push data-driven-decision-making.

Conclusion 
This Travel Analysis Dashboard proves that data analytics has multi-dimensional potential. With redesigning the same dataset, I was able to construct an entirely unique project that integrates with that of the previous Indian Transport and Mobility Analysis to show just how impressive creativity and technical skill can be in analytics.
