<h2>📖 Project Narrative</h2>

<p>
During the <b>Indian Transportation and Mobility Analysis</b>, I uncovered unique travel patterns and behavioral trends within the dataset.  
These findings sparked the idea to build a new project — the <b>Travel Analysis Dashboard</b>.  
</p>

<p>
This dashboard focuses on understanding regional mobility behavior, travel segments, and transportation preferences.  
Using the <b>same dataset</b>, I approached the problem from a fresh angle and created a visually rich and insightful dashboard.
